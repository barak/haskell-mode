haskell-mode (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. closes: 281998.

  * Updated copyright file to show new Debian and upstream maintainers.
    closes: 286769

  * keybindings C-c <char> have been replaced by C-c C-<char> so as not to
    collide with minor modes.
  
  * The following modules are now automatically activated without having
    to add anything to haskell-mode-hook: haskell-font-lock (just turn on
    global-font-lock-mode).  haskell-decl-scan (just bind `imenu' to some
    key).
  
  * In recent Emacsen, haskell-doc hooks into eldoc-mode.
  
  * haskell-hugs and haskell-ghci are superceded by inf-haskell.
  
  * Indentation rules have been improved when using layout inside parens/braces.
  
  * Symbols like -> and \ can be displayed as actual arrows and lambdas.
    See haskell-font-lock-symbols.
  
  * Tweaks to the font-lock settings.  Among other things paren-matching
    with things like \(x,y) should work correctly now.
  
  * New upstream maintainer <monnier@gnu.org>.

haskell-mode (1.45-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Bugs relating to indentation and comments seem to be fixed.
    closes: #46115, closes: #51821
  * Not much information from upstream about changes.  I'm not sure if
    this is exaustive:
    "Support for proper behaviour (including with Unicode identifiers)
    in Emacs 21 only hacked in messily to avoid disturbing the old
    stuff.  Needs integrating more cleanly.  Allow literate comment
    face to be customized.  Some support for fontifying definitions."
