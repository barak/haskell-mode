Description: Hugs interaction mode no longer turned on by default
 The 0.4 release of haskell-mode adds support for GHCi interaction.
 Unfortunately, it conflicts with the Hugs interaction mode previously
 turned on by default.  Thus, neither of the modes are turned on by
 default anymore.
 .
 If you want to turn one of them on by default for all users, edit
  /etc/emacs/site-start.d/50haskell-mode.el
 Individual users can turn one of them on by default by adding
 either
  (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-hugs)
 or
  (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-ghci)
 to their own ~/.emacs.
 .
 The interaction modes can be turned on for individual buffers by typing
 M-x turn-on-haskell-hugs or M-x turn-on-haskell-ghci.
